# BaltimoreTrails

## Overview
The BaltimoreTrails R package is a comprehensive toolkit designed to facilitate the integration, manipulation, visualization, and interactive access of Baltimore datasets. Developed as part of the DataTrail initiative by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, this package aims to provide a more localized and relevant learning experience for students.

## Features
The primary feature of the BaltimoreTrails package is the integration of Baltimore datasets. These datasets cover a wide range of topics and domains, providing a rich resource for students to explore and learn from. The package provides functions for loading these datasets into the R environment, manipulating the data, and creating visualizations.

The BaltimoreTrails package builds on several existing open-source R packages, including popular packages for data manipulation (such as dplyr and tidyr), data visualization (such as ggplot2), and the development of interactive web applications (such as shiny). By building on these existing packages, BaltimoreTrails provides a user-friendly and familiar interface for DataTrail scholars.

## Installation
You can install the BaltimoreTrails package from GitHub using the following command in R:
```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("datatrail-jhu/BaltimoreTrails")
```

## Usage
After installation, you can load the BaltimoreTrails package in R using the library function:
```{r}
library(BaltimoreTrails)
```

You can then use the functions provided by the package to load the Baltimore datasets, manipulate the data, and create visualizations.

## Contributing
The BaltimoreTrails package is hosted on GitHub, allowing for open-source development and collaboration. We welcome community contributions and feedback. Please feel free to submit issues and pull requests.

## Future Work
Future enhancements to the BaltimoreTrails package will focus on expanding its capabilities, including the development of additional data manipulation and visualization functions, the integration of additional datasets, and the development of additional learnR chapter tutorials.
